Brew

Some notes on homebrew recipes I've done with friends. Measured in metric.

It's also (officially) impossible to fail beer. We've boiled the mash about 10Â°C
above normal, dropped about four times the appropriate hops amount and it still
tastes interesting. Maybe not the best, but it's all right.

Just don't sneeze into the wort.
